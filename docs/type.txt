<prefix>_map_new_alt_rs.txt	rs id not found in db but db already has another rs id for that variant	grab rsid profile from dbsnp website	map_new_alt_rs.sh	out_map_new_alt_rs.txt	additional column with dbsnp look up	if db version is latest update map table and add as alt id to db. If map table version is more recent update db
<prefix>_map_new_pos_mismatch.txt	variant position does not match db (b38) position(s)	grab rsid profile from dbsnp website	map_new_pos_mismatch.sh	out_new_pos_mismatch_rs.txt	additional column with dbsnp look up	can report to vendor. Can update map table, particularly if rsid is available and can confirm position against db version with dbsnp lookup
<prefix>_map_new_rs.txt	map table rsid not known to db, map table non-rsid in db consensus instead	n/a	n/a	n/a	n/a	swap the rsid into the db consensus, put the non-rsid as alt id in db
<prefix>_map_new_rs_byalt.txt	map table rsid not known to db, map table non-rsid in db alt_ids instead	n/a	n/a	n/a	n/a	swap the rsid into the db consensus, put the old db consensus id in as alt_id

<prefix>_map_notindb.txt	variants are unknown to consensus db	pending	pending	pending	pending	these can be added to consensus db but we should download the flank sequences because map tables only have coords for these
<prefix>_map_notindb_coordmatch.txt	variants are unknown to consensus db by their id but the coord is present under another id	n/a	n/a	n/a	n/a	map table id can be added to consensus as alt_id
<prefix>_map_pos_for_oo.txt	variants have 0:0 position in map table but a genuine position is available in consensus db	n/a	n/a	n/a	n/a	could update map tables but these 0:0 represent some kind of false/failed variant
<prefix>_map_rs_from_omics.txt	rs id not known to map table	n/a	n/a	n/a	n/a	update map table with rsid from consensus db
